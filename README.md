Deep Neural Networks_The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset


The Real Problem
Recognizing multi-digit numbers in photographs captured at street level is an important
component of modern-day map making. A classic example of a corpus of such street
level photographs are Googleâ€™s Street View imagery comprised of hundreds of millions of
geo-located 360-degree panoramic images. The ability to automatically transcribe an
address number from a geo-located patch of pixels and associate the transcribed
number with a known street address helps pinpoint, with a high degree of accuracy, the
location of the building it represents.
More broadly, recognizing numbers in photographs is a problem of interest to the optical
character recognition community. While OCR on constrained domains like document
processing is well studied, arbitrary multi-character text recognition in photographs is
still highly challenging. This difficulty arises due to the wide variability in the visual
appearance of text in the wild on account of a large range of fonts, colors, styles,
orientations, and character arrangements. The recognition problem is further
complicated by environmental factors such as lighting, shadows, specularities, and
occlusions as well as by image acquisition factors such as resolution, motion, and focus
blurs.
In this project, we will use the dataset with images centered around a single digit (many of the
images do contain some distractors at the sides). Although we are taking a sample of
the data which is simpler, it is more complex than MNIST because of the distractors.
The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset
SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and object
recognition algorithms with the minimal requirement on data formatting but comes from a
significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in
natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View
images.
